## Summary 

This repository contains the final project for the cour "Practicum ELO-ICT", 
the goal of this is to drive an ledmatrix with the aid of Zynq2 FPGA, STM32 and other components.

The repo contains:
- VHDL test bench code
- PCB:
    - stm32 shield
    - external ledmatrixdriver
- STM32 test code
